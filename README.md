# 📺 Netflix Data Visualization Project

This project explores and visualizes Netflix's dataset to uncover trends in content type, duration, ratings, release patterns, and country-wise production. Using Python and data visualization libraries, I created various charts and plots to analyze the streaming platform's content over the years.
